# Portfolio-Viewr
This python script uses pygame to load and display images typically in an artistâ€™s portfolio. Each file is defined as a class, with artwork name, creation date, and additional notes if desired. Each time the user clicks left or right on the arrow keys, the next image displays as a loop. Each slide includes the images corresponding artwork name/date/notes.

The artist used consented to allow her work to be used during the creation of this script, however I do not have permission to post the work. Her portfolio is posted for those interested. 
This portfolio viewer will not work unless the file names are changed - those using this for educational purposes or for the purpose of testing the script are welcome to make edits/replace the pictures to their own copies as desired - though If this is used primarily as-is (no changes to other code) would prefer that slide 1 (Cover page) is not changed. 
Please note lines 57 through 66 define the files that the script uses and displays. Please read the #comments to see which fields effect which notes for the variable class to effect displayed text, and be sure to update the list on line 66 if adding additional files, so that the loop correctly counts them and displays them in the order that they appear on the list.
