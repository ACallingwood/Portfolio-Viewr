# Portfolio-Viewr
This python script uses pygame to load and display images typically in an artistâ€™s portfolio. Each file is defined as a class, with artwork name, creation date, and additional notes if desired. Each time the user clicks left or right on the arrow keys, the next image displays as a loop. Each slide includes the images corresponding artwork name/date/notes.

The artist used consented to allow her work to be used during the creation of this script, however I do not have permission to post the work. Her portfolio is posted for those interested. 
This portfolio viewer will not work unless the file names are changed - those using this for educational purposes or for the purpose of testing the script are welcome to made edits to their own copies as needed.
For those unfamiliar with python / comments please refer to code lines 57 through 66 which define the files that the script uses. Please note the #comments to see which fields effect which notes for the class in regards to the displayed text, and be sure to update the list on line 66 if adding additional files. 
The loop will work for any length of files so long as the list (line 66) is updated to include each file variable name.
